# hello-world
my first repository
=======
Okay, My name is Molly, and I'm trying to learn how to make webpages.  I'm learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and Javascript, and I need a place to practice what I'm learning.  So far, I'm a little intimidated by GitHub, but I'm hoping that I'm on the right track learning and using it.  That's all for now.
